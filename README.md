# philosophers

## Description:
This project main objective is to create threads and, consequentially, to do multithreading to demonstrate the philosophers dinner table problem. (insert later what is the problem)

## Skills learned:
- Multithreading: <PLACEHOLDER>

## Usage:
1. Make the files with "make all";
2. Run the program with ```./philo``` and entering four/five arguments:
	2.1. Number of philosophers (max 200);
	2.2. Time to die;
	2.3. Time to eat;
	2.4. Time to sleep;
	2.5. Number of times each philosopher must eat (optional);
3. Observe time stamps;

1. In parsing() the loop was not outputting the proper message for negative numbers being inputted. Took out the if statement that was blocking the message;
2. Git branches were outdated, got all branches up to date;
3. Tested for different positive integer cases of philosophers:
	3.1. One philosopher: OK;
	3.2. Five philosophers: OK;
	3.3. Zero before actual number of philos: OK (all cases);
	3.4. 200 philos: OK;
	3.5. Negatives (error handling): OK;
	3.6. Zeroes: OK;
4. Added zero checks with ft_atoi() in parsing();
5. Reduced redundancies in the code. Works the same, but now its more readable;
6. Reestructured files for organization;
7. Initialized the mutex lock within philosophize(), but there is no output coming from the threads;
